    "The model parameterisations refer to the set of parameters that are varied and estimated in a retrieval. Given that the computational time of retrievals largely depend on the number of fitted parameters, the input information in the atmospheric classes is often parameterised to reduce this number. ArchNEMESIS includes a large set of model parameterisations heritage from the original NEMESIS code and which might be useful for many applications. Nevertheless, new parameterisations can also be easily introduced to develop new methodologies for the analysis of planetary spectra.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The information about the model parameterisations is stored in the *Variables* class. Given the different forms parameterisations may take, this class needs to be versatile to store all the relevant information about the model parameters and the indications of what information must be changed in the forward model based on a particular parameterisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of parameterisation is indicated by the VARIDENT parameter of the *Variables* class. For each parameterisation included in the model, VARIDENT is a three-element integer array. The logic behind this array is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's call the three elements of the array I$_1$, I$_2$, I$_3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I$_3$ indicates the ID for the particular parameterisation, following the identifiers listed in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the selected model ID does not correspond to an atmospheric model, then I$_1$ and I$_2$ do not provide any useful information, and they can get arbitrary numbers. However, if the model ID corresponds to an atmospheric parameterisation, then I$_1$ and I$_2$ indicate the atmospheric parameter that must be modified. In particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If I$_1$ = 0, then the model parameterisation applies to the temperature profile.\n",
    "    - If I$_1$ > 0, then the model parameterisation applies to the volume mixing ratio of a particular gas, with I$_1$ and I$_2$ representing the gas ID and isotope ID (e.g., I$_1$=1, I$_2$=0 for H$_2$O;  I$_1$=1, I$_2$=4 for HDO).\n",
    "    - If I$_1$ < 0, then we can have:\n",
    "        - If 1 $\\leq$ |I$_1$| $\\leq$ NDUST, then the model parameterisation applies to the I$_1$ aerosol population.\n",
    "        - If |I$_1$| = NDUST + 1, then the model parameterisation applies to the para-H$_2$ fraction profile.\n",
    "        - If |I$_1$| = NDUST + 1, then the model parameterisation applies to the fractional cloud cover profile.\n",

    "The model parameterisations have the purpose of modifying the information in the reference classes according to a smaller number of parameters. This is especially important for retrievals, when these parameters are modified in each iteration to find the best fit between the modelled and measured spectra. Each of the model parameterisations is defined by some Variable IDs and Variable parameters, which are defined in the *.apr* file. This file can be read using the *read_apr* function on the Variables class. \n",

    "# Custom Model Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Users may want to define their own custom parameterisations ande create new retrieval schemes for their specific purposes. Implementing new parameterisations in archNEMESIS is relatively straightforward, at the simplest level you just need to add a new class to one of the *Models/AtmosphericModels.py*, *Models/NonAtmosphericModels.py*, or *Models/SpectralModels.py* files. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are in the process of rationalising the model classes, so we recommend using the below model classes as a guide:\n",
    "* In the *Models/AtmosphericModels.py* file:\n",
    "  - *Model2*\n",
    "  - *Model3*\n",
    "  - *Model9*\n",
    "  - *Model32*\n",
    "  - *Model45*\n",
    "  - *Model47*\n",
    "* In the *Models/NonAtmosphericModels.py* file:\n",
    "  - *Model444*\n",
    "* In the *Models/SpectralModels.py* file:\n",
    "  - *Model231*\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: In each file there is a template model class, that is the result of the steps (2) and (3) (detailed below), that has the methods that need to be implemented. The body of each method body consists of `raise NotImplementedError('This is a template model and should never be used')` as the first expression and some example code with explanatory comments, just copy the template model class, rename it, give it a unique ID, and replace the method bodies with the required code for your model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The templates model classes are:\n",
    "* *TemplateAtmosphericModel* in the *Models/AtmosphericModels.py* file\n",
    "* *TemplateNonAtmosphericModel* in the *Models/NonAtmosphericModels.py* file\n",
    "* *TemplateSpectralModel* in the *Models/SpectralModels.py* file\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Work out what kind of model you are creating, this informs where you put your new model class.\n",
    "  - Atmospheric models (in *Models/AtmosphericModels.py*) affect one of the following atmosphere profiles: \n",
    "    * gas volume mixing ratio\n",
    "    * aerosol species (dust) density\n",
    "    * temperature\n",
    "    * para-h2 fraction\n",
    "    * fractional cloud cover\n",
    "  - Spectral models (in *Models/SpectralModels.py*) affect the the modelled output spectrum directly.\n",
    "  - Non-Atmospheric models (in *Models/NonAtmosphericModels.py*) affect other things, e.g.:\n",
    "    * Optical properties of an aerosol species\n",
    "    * Instrument lineshape\n",
    "    * Doppler shift of the observer w.r.t the target\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Look at the *ModelBase* class in the *Models/ModelBase.py* file. List any **abstract methods** on the class (they are marked with `@abstractmethod`)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the file that corresponds to the type of model you are creating, look at the \"model type base class\" (at the top of the file) : *AtmosphericModelBase* for *Models/AtmosphericModels.py*; *SpectralModelBase* for *Models/SpectralModels.py*; *NonAtmosphericModelBase* for *Models/NonAtmosphericModels.py*. Do the following:\n",
    "   * Any methods with the same name as an **abstract method** of the *ModelBase* class does **NOT** have to be implemented, as the \"model type base class\" already provides an implementation for you. You can cross these off your list.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * Any **abstract methods** on the \"model type base class\" (they are marked with `@abstractmethod`), **DO** have to be implemented. Add these to your list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Write a new class that implements all of the **abstract methods** on your list, and give it an integer class attribute `id` that is a unique ID number that will be used to identify your custom model. Use the other implementations in the file as a guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Custom Model Class\n",
    "\n",
    "As it is much easier to see the above process in action, we present a walkthrough example of implementing a custom model. The example we are using is not going to be *useful*, but it serves as a guide that shows how to do something non-trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our custom model will parameterise the volume mixing ratio of a gas as a stepwise function. This is not really that *useful*, but it gives us the opportunity to explore how to do a few different things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the above procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1 is to work out what kind of model we are creating. In this case the model is an Atmospheric model (as it alters a gas volume mixing ratio), so we will put the model in the *Models/AtmosphericModels.py* file.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 2 is to look at *ModelBase* and *AtmosphericModelBase* and write down the **abstract methods** that require an implementation. At the time of writng (20/05/2025), these are the relevant methods on the two classes:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - *ModelBase* **abstract methods**:\n",
    "    + `is_varident_valid`\n",
    "    + `from_apr_to_state_vector`\n",
    "    + `calculate`\n",
    "    + `calculate_from_subprofretg`\n",
    "    + `patch_from_subprofretg`\n",
    "    + `calculate_from_subspecret`\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - *AtmosphericModelBase* **concrete methods** (i.e. non-abstract):\n",
    "    + `is_varident_valid`\n",
    "    + `patch_from_subprofretg`\n",
    "    + `calculate_from_subspecret`\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - *AtmosphericModelBase* **abstract methods**:\n",
    "    + `calculate_from_subprofretg`\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if we combine the **abstract methods** from both classes, and then remove the **concrete methods** of *AtmosphericModelBase*, we have the following list of methods that our new class needs to implement: `from_apr_to_state_vector`, `calculate`, `calculate_from_subprofretg`. This is step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the template class in *Models/AtmosphericModels.py* to speed up steps (2) and (3), we just copy the template class, rename it, and re-write its methods to do what we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4 is to actually implement the methods, and is performed in the following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### first definitions of the model class\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, we need a name. The current model names are things like *Model45*, they are holdovers from the FORTRAN code and are not very descriptive. Ideally we want something that describes what the model represents, \"PiecewiseGasVMR\" is a decent choice so we will use that. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we need an ID number, we should choose something that is somewhat consistent with the current ID numbers if possible. I will use 10 for this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, we should add a docstring to the class that describes it.\n",
    "\n",

    "class PiecewiseGasVMR(AtmosphericModelBase):\n",
    "   \"\"\"\n",
    "   Parameterises the gas volume mixing ratio as a piecewise function with `n_chunk` chunks.\n",

    "* `calculate_from_subprofretg` is called when forward modelling, inside `ForwardModel_0::subprofretg`.\n",
    "* `calculate` is called inside `calculate_from_subprofretg` as that method performs the actual calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### writing `from_apr_to_state_vector`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Considering the `varident` for the model. Reading the documentation, `AtmosphericModelBase::is_varident_valid` method, and other model class's `from_apr_to_state_vector` implementations shows that, when we are dealing with an atmospheric model, the three integers in `varident` are defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `varident[0]` \n",
    "  - `== 0` denotes a temperature profile\n",
    "  - `> 0` denotes a gas ID that is equal to `varident[0]`.\n",
    "  - `< 0`\n",
    "   + is an aerosol species profile when the magnitude is less than or equal to the number of aerosol species\n",
    "   + a para-h2 fraction profile when the magnitude is equal to the number of aerosol species + 1\n",
    "   + a fractional cloud cover profile when the magnitude is equal to the number of aerosol species + 2\n",
    "* `varident[1]` is the ID of the gas *isotope* **if** `varident[0]` is a gas ID.\n",
    "* `model_id` denotes the ID number of the model to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore,\n",
    "1) we can assume that `varident[2]` is equal to the `cls.id` of our model. This is what `AtmosphericModelBase::is_varident_valid` ensures.\n",
    "2) our model requires `varident[0]` to be positive as it must be a gas ID\n",
    "3) `varident[1]` is an isotope ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add the following code to the `from_apr_to_state_vector` method:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# unpack values from VARIDENT\n",
    "gas_id = varident[0]\n",
    "assert gas_id > 0, f'model {cls.__name__} with id={cls.id} must have a gas ID as the first VARIDENT value'\n",
    "iso_id = varident[1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### reading apriori parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to read the apriori coefficients from the <runname>.apr file. The simplest way to do this is to add some extra lines to the <runname>.apr file after the VARIDENT for our model. The first line will be the number of chunks, the next `n_chunk` lines be a space separated list of the chunk values and their errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `f` argument is the file descriptor of the open <runname>.apr file at the line *after* the VARIDENT for our model. Therefore we just need to read `n_chunk+1` lines from the file and unpack the values in the way we just said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `npro` argument is the number of points in each profile, we want our piecewise function to have at least two points shared in each chunk, so we want to make sure we have enough points in the profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add the following code to the `from_apr_to_state_vector` method:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# read in apriori parameters\n",
    "# read number of chunks\n",
    "n_chunk = int(f.readline().strip())\n",
    "\n",
    "# ensure we have at least 2 profile points per chunk\n",
    "assert npro >= 2*n_chunk, f'{cls.__name__} id={cls.id} must have at most half as many chunks as there are points in a profile, have {n_chunk} vs {npro}'\n",
    "\n",

    "for i in range(coeff.size):\n",
    "   chunk[i], chunk_err[i] = tuple(map(float, f.readline().strip().split()))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### packing the state vector and the covariance matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to pack the apriori parameter values into the statevector and pack the parameter errors into the covariance vector. Note, as we have not set any correlation between our chunks, we can just set the diagonal covariance matrix elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ix` argument is the next unused index of the state vector. We will need `ix` along with:\n",
    "* `lx` - the log flag for the state vector, denotes if a parameter is stored as a log of its \"real\" value.\n",
    "* `x0` - the actual state vector\n",
    "* `sx` - the covariance matrix\n",
    "* `inum` - flag for the state vector, denotes if the derivative of a parameter should be numerically calculated or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we want to:\n",
    "1) store the parameters in the state vector. NOTE: we should store the log of their value as the chunk values cannot be negative.\n",
    "2) store the errors in the covariance matrix.\n",
    "3) set the log flag for our parameters\n",

We can also get it by using the `Atmosphere_0::locate_gas(...)` method on the same object as we have stored the `gas_id` and `iso_id` values on the model instance.
