    "archNEMESIS is an algorithm designed to 1) generate a forward model of the spectrum of a planetary atmosphere based on a set of input parameters, and 2) perform atmospheric retrievals, by which some of the input parameters are iteratively modified until the simulated spectrum best fits the measured one.\n",

    "- Model parameterisations: These are a set of parameters that are iteratively modified in our model to find the best fit between the modelled and measured spectrum. In atmospheric retrievals, these variables are more generally known as the state vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forward Model: It refers to the set of functions that solve the radiative transfer equation and allow the calculation of the spectrum based on the model inputs and parameterisations.\n",

The information is essentially the same, but the format of the files benefits from a tailored structure for this version. In particular, a forward model or retrieval in archNEMESIS can be run by reading information from a single HDF5 file. This file format allows the organisation of the data in a hierarchical manner using groups and datasets. This format is particularly useful for the structure of the inputs from archNEMESIS, since each of the reference classes corresponds to a unique group within the file, which includes all the information (i.e., datasets) for that particular class.\n",

In addition, these methods write metadata to easily visualise the contents of the file (i.e., includes of explanation of each variable in the file, units, and selected flags). HDF5 files can be visualised by using specific software. If using Visual Studio Code, we recommend using the [H5Web](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=h5web.vscode-h5web) extension to easily read the contents.
