__________

ArchNEMESIS is an open source Python package developed for the analysis of remote sensing spectroscopic observations of planetary atmospheres. 
It is based on the widely used NEMESIS (Non-linear Optimal Estimator for MultivariatE Spectral analySIS) radiative transfer and retrieval tool, 
which has been extensively used for the investigation of a wide variety of planetary environments.

ArchNEMESIS is currently maintained by `Juan Alday <https://research.open.ac.uk/people/ja22256>`_ and `Joseph Penn <https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/penn>`_.
The `NEMESIS <https://nemesiscode.github.io/index.html>`_ algorithm, code archNEMESIS is based on, was originally developed by `Patrick Irwin <https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/irwin>`_.

In this website, we aim to provide a detailed description of the code and its functionalities. In addition, we include several jupyter notebooks
to help users get used to some of these functionalities. 

If interested users are missing key points in the documentation, would appreciate seeing jupyter notebooks for certain purposes, or want to report issues, please do so by contacting us or joining our `Discord <https://discord.gg/Te43qbrVFK>`_ channel.

Installation
--------------------

There are three main ways to install archNEMESIS, depending on your use case:

Installing from PyPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The simplest way to install archNEMESIS is via PyPI.
We recommend doing this inside a clean Python virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m venv archnemesis-env
   source archnemesis-env/bin/activate
   pip install archnemesis

This will install the latest stable release of the package along with its dependencies.
It is the recommended method if you just want to use the library without editing the source code.


Installing from GitHub (developer mode)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install the latest development version, clone the GitHub repository:

.. code-block:: bash    

   git clone https://github.com/juanaldayparejo/archnemesis-dist.git
 
Before installing archNEMESIS, we recommend users to create and load a new Python `virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ for a clean install:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m venv name_of_virtual_environment/
   source name_of_virtual_environment/bin/activate

Then move into the package directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd archnemesis-dist

Finally, install the library in editable mode:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --editable .

This will install archNEMESIS along with all required dependencies, while keeping the source editable.
